# Learning Session Generator
This is an app created with Streamlit and OpenAI API that generates a detailed learning plan for primary education teachers in Spanish. The learning plan includes components such as learning objectives, activity preparation, strategy development, assessment rubric, and reflection. The plan is generated using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and includes a chatbot which also uses this engine. Finally, the user is allowed to download the responses in a .docx file.
